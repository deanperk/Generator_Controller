Current Fault 

The existing (model number?) alternator is capable of a maximum output of
 100A at 24V
The nominal output current should be no more than 80A
The alternator output is a function of the engine RPM and the system
 battery bank voltage

In normal operation the running engine RPM will nominally be 2XXX RPM
3600 RPM is the absolute maximum for the existing engine

Fault Conditions
	High Current Fault - 
	 Current levels of 5% above nominal (84A) are allowable for a period of X 
	  minutes
	 Current levels of 10% above nominal (88A) are allowable for a period of Y
	   minutes
	 A high current fault exists if he above conditions are exceeded
	 The result of a high current fault is engine shutdown and an alarm contact
	  closure. A message will be sent to the LCD panel
	Low Current Fault - output current is <XXA
      The result of a low current fault is an alarm contact closure and
       a message sent to the LCD panel.  A current value of 0A suggests
       is potentially a result of an open circuit (failed connection, circuit breaker
       opened) and will result in an engine shutdown.

In the first generation of the generator controller the engine RPM may
 be manually adjusted by the operator by setting an RPM value controlled
 by a potentiometer mounted on the front panel. Theere is no means
 to automatically control engine RPM

Future updates to the generator controller could include a means for the
 controller to automatically adjust the engine RPM to vary the altenator
 current output. A manual means of adjustment will still be required.
