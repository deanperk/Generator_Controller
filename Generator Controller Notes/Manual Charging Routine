Manual Charging Routine
	Manual and automatic charging modes will be identical except for the start/end signal

Variables to hold states
	Mode - operating mode Off, Auto, Manual
	boolean engineRun - normal RPM or low/zero RPM
    boolean oilFault - oil level switch fault
    boolean voltFault - low voltage fault
    boolean tempFault - system battery overtemp fault
    boolean currentFault - current is overrange or underrange (see current fault notes)
    boolean modeFault (not used)
    boolean fanOn - fan run signal is asserted
    boolean loadOn - system battery bank connected 
    boolean startFault - failed to start after 5 attempts
    boolean fanFault (future feature when a fan signal is available)
    boolean criticalFault - a fault that will result in a shutdown
    int runTime - user selkectable via a rotary switch


Timer Interrupt
	1 Hz interrupt (0.1Hz?) will increment a counter named countHour

Manual Start
 starts with either the momentary start switch or a low voltage threshold

Manual Charging 
	Manual charge runTime is user selectable or set to 4 hours if low voltage start
	Immediately after successful start, run a 2 minute engine warm up (no load)
		During warm up monitor oilFault, disable timer interrupt
	
	//Immediatly after start
	//send warmup message to LCD
	//    voltage, temperature, RPM, WARMUP
	//set engineRun = true
	
	while (millis + startTime ?){
	//waiting for 2 minute warmup
    //check for faults
	}


	Immediately after warm up -
		reset countHour to 0
		connect load
	Continue charging until either the runtime is complete or a fault occurs 
	During charging loop monitor the mode (no change from manual mode),
	 fan cooling (turn on or off), voltage, current, temperature, RPM
	 Read countHour and do schedued tasks - countHour % X = 0
	 	check faults every 1 minute
		check fan cooling every 10 minutes
	 	datalog 1/hr
	 	decrement runtime every hour

	while ((runTime > 0) && (faults==false) && (mode = manual)){
	if (countHour % 60 == 0) {
	//run fault check function
	   }
	if (countHour % 600 == 0){
	//run fan function
	   }
	if (countHour % 3600 == 0) {
	//run datalog function
    	}
	} 	
	//Stop charge
	//wait for next start sequence or a mode change
