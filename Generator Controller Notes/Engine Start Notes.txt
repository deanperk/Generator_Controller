Engine Start Notes

Starting in Manual Mode and Automatic Mode is identical except for:
Manual Mode - engine start signal is the Start Switch Contact Closure
              If a low battery voltage of <=21V occurs, engine will
			  start automatically and run for a fixed period of 4 hours
Automatic Mode - engine start signal is a voltage threshold of <22 V

Start Sequence (create a function for engine start)
	Determine that no fault conditions exist that prevent START from occuring
	Enable START ENABLE relay
	Wait for start switch or start voltage (value? 22 volts?)
	Turn on Aux Load
	Close START relay and set START flag (is flag necessary? same as RPM measurement?)
		maximum START signal time is 5 seconds per attempt with a 2 second
		rest between attempts
		After 5 unsuccessful attempts, quit trying and report a START fault
		Determine success (running or not running) by monitoring RPM
		RPM >900 is running
		RPM <400 is cranking
		RPM >400 <900 is poor running mode
	If successful START 
		open START relay and clear START flag
		Wait for 2 minute engine warm up
		Close load contactor
		Turn Off Aux Load (Leave aux load connected the entire time engine is running?)
	START Sequence is now complete
